h2. What is Unity?

Unity is a unit test framework written entirely in the C language. It has special features for embedded systems. It has scaled well from small to large embedded projects, but can be used for any C project.

h2. Local changes to this Fork...

* NOTE: Most of the changes to this fork require the use of the ruby helpers
and rake

# Added colour support (requires win32 gem on windows)
# Added support for test file filtering via
 _test_file_filter.yml_. Test file filtering is overridden by 
 _rake cruise_, _rake ci_ and _rake all_unit_tests_ for _continuous integration_ purposes
# Added TEST_ONLY() macro. Within a test function causes just this
test to be run). Used in conjunction with
test_file_filtering
# Fixed TEST_ASSERT() macro (was catching a FALSE assertion but wasn't
displaying anything)
# Added test_runner.watchr for continuous testing. 
_> watchr test_runner.watchr_ causes the watchr daemon to run the tests
automatically when a test or source file is modified (saved). Modify test_runner.watchr to suit your
project. Requires the watchr gem
