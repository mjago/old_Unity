h2. What is Unity?

Unity is a unit test framework written entirely in the C language. It has special features for embedded systems. It has scaled well from small to large embedded projects, but can be used for any C project.

h2. Local changes to this Fork...

* NOTE: Most of the changes to this fork require the use of the ruby helpers
and rake

# Added *colour support* (requires win32 gem on windows)
# Added support for *test file filtering*. 
Test file filtering is controlled by modifying  "test_file_filter.yml":http://github.com/mjago/Unity/blob/master/test_file_filter.yml. For *continuous integration* purposes, test file filtering can be overridden with *rake cruise*, *rake ci*, or *rake all_unit_tests*
# Added *TEST_ONLY()* macro. Within a test function causes just this
test to be run). Used in conjunction with
test_file_filtering
# Fixed *TEST_ASSERT()* macro (was catching a FALSE assertion but wasn't
displaying anything)
# Added *test_runner.watchr script* for continuous testing. 
_> watchr test_runner.watchr_ causes the watchr daemon to run the tests
automatically when a test or source file is modified (saved). Modify "test_runner.watchr":http://github.com/mjago/Unity/blob/master/test_runner.watchr to suit your
project. Requires the watchr gem
