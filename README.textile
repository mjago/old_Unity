h2. What is Unity?

Unity is a unit test framework written entirely in the C language. It has special features for embedded systems. It has scaled well from small to large embedded projects, but can be used for any C project.

h2. Local changes to this Fork...

# NOTE: Most of the changes to this fork require the use of the ruby helpers
and rake
# Added colour support (requires win32 gem on windows)
# Added support for test file filtering via test_file_filter.yml
# Added TEST_ONLY() macro. Within a test function causes just this
test to be run (from this file). Used in conjunction with
test_file_filtering to isolate from tests in other test files."
